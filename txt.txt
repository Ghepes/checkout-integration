I've implemented a server-side proxy approach to solve the CORS issues you're experiencing. 

1. **Created a Proxy API Route**:

1. Added a new `/api/proxy-checkout` route in your main application
2. This route forwards requests to the checkout server and returns the response
3. Since this request is made server-to-server, it avoids CORS restrictions



2. **Updated the Cart Component**:

1. Modified the `handleCheckout` function to use the proxy API instead of directly calling the external checkout server
2. Added loading state to disable the checkout button during processing
3. Added error handling with toast notifications
4. Added session storage to track pending checkouts



3. **Updated the Success Page**:

1. Made it a client component to access the cart state
2. Added logic to clear the cart after a successful checkout
3. Updated to work with just the session ID



## Why This Approach Works

1. **Avoids CORS Issues**: By using a server-side proxy, we avoid the browser's CORS restrictions entirely
2. **Maintains Separation of Concerns**: The checkout logic still happens on the external server
3. **Improves User Experience**: Added loading states and better error handling
4. **Ensures Cart Cleanup**: The cart is properly cleared after a successful checkout


This approach should resolve the CORS issues while maintaining the separation between your main application and the checkout service. The proxy API route acts as a bridge between the two, handling the communication in a way that avoids browser restrictions.
